# libunwind uses some double-checked locking which isn't perfectly safe.
# Reported at http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?42677
#
# With TSAN in clang 3.5, it's the init() function that's flagged as a data
# race (not local_addr_space_init()), due to the former calling sigfillset()
# on an unprotected global variable. Given that init() invokes
# local_addr_space_init(), suppressing init() suppresses both races.

# libev uses some lock-free synchronization, but doesn't have TSAN annotations.
# See http://lists.schmorp.de/pipermail/libev/2013q2/002178.html or KUDU-366
# for examples.
